# Lab 1

- This repository is setup to contain the files for Lab 1 from OPTI 571L, the computational optical physics lab, or, colloquially known as the computational Quantum mecahnics lab.
- It is required of us to submit progress on labs on a weekly basis.




## Elements of the lab

- Lab 1 is largely design to have you start to think about implementing basic quantum mechanics in matlab in a very guided way.
- Along the way, many important matlab functions will be introduced that will make life easier.
